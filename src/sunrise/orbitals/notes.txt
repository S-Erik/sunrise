https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/zimmerman-lab/ they should have the link to the code on https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4923084 but I dont find it
maybe better to write them, if the pipek_mezey localization doesnt works properly

I belive this is the localization code used for the algorithmiq paper, wait for jakob to answer, maybe read LoDo paper
